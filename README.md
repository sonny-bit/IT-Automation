# IT Automation
This repository contains PowerShell and Bash scripts used to install common applications on both Windows and Mac. 

I also leveraged [JumpCloud PowerShell](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/support/wiki/Using-the-JumpCloud-PowerShell-Module#jumpcloud-powershell-commands-example-library) modules and [API documentation](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/index.html) to automate and streamline various administrative tasks. This includes PowerShell scripts that interact with the JumpCloud API to retrieve data, which is subsequently stored in SQL tables for reporting and analysis.
