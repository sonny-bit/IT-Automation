# PowerShell Software Install Scripts
Most of the PowerShell scripts install software directly from a provided link. By analyzing the HTML content, some PowerShell scripts retrieve the direct link for the latest version of the software. Certain scripts, such as the one for Google Chrome, install the software by saving the installer package in a NAS or shared folder. Additionally, some scripts, like the one for Slack, run as the current user during installation.
